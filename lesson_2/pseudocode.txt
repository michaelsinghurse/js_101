#1 A function that returns that returns the sum of two number.

Given two numbers, n1 and n2
Return the sum of the two numbers.

START

GET the value of two numbers.

RETURN the sum o the numbers.

END

#2 A function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string
that is all those strings concatenated together.

Given an array of strings.
Set a new variable equal to an empty string.
Loop through each element of that array and concatenate each element to the 
new variable.
Once the loop finishes, return that variable to the caller.

START

GET the array of strings from the user.

SET myString = empty string.
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < the length of the calling array
  SET currentString = user array's element at index of iterator
  SET myString = myString + currentString
  SET iterator = iterator + 1
  
RETURN myString

END

#3 A function that takes an array of  integers, and returns a new array 
with every other element.

Given an array of integers.
Initialize a new empty array.
Initialize a variable, call it push, and set it equal to true.
Loop through each element of the array.
If push is true, then add the element to the new array. If push is false,
then do nothing.
Set the push value to it's opposite. E.g. if true, then false.
Once the loop is finished, return the new array to the caller.

START

GET userArray which is passed from the caller

SET newArray = empty array []
SET counter = 0
SET push = true

WHILE counter < userArray's length
  SET currentVal = value of element at the index of iterator
  IF push is true
    add currentVal to newArray
  SET push to it's opposite. i.e. push = !push
  
RETURN newArray
